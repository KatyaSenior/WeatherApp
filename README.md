PRESENTATION:
Problem domain:
-Weather app using geolocation
User stories:
-As a user, we want the location of the user to appear on the screen as well as current and temperature and forecast.
-As a user, we want to submit information through a form and see it displayed on the page without a full page refresh
-As a user, we want to be able to view a list of entries that have been added by all the users, stored in the database
We want the website to be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices
-Original MVP goal was for London's temperature to appear based on longitude and latitude coordinates built into the API.
Stretch goals:
• Geolocation and comments…
• We also want the user to be able to select a different location to see the current weather and forecast
• User submitted comments appear based on locations
• Forecast for following days
• Adding photos to the comments
• Weather based background – background changes according to the weather
• Details such as windspeed, humidity, rainfall etc
• Let the user select a city
